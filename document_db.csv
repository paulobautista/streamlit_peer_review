## Acceptance/Response: What is the retailers response to Lorillard's Excel
Merchandising Program?

**Chains:** This program has been successful to date with chains where our ""Flex
Payment"" was not in place. The chains where we were using the ""Flex Payment""
system we have not been as successful. The P.O.S. requirements of the P-1 Plan
with Oil Companies is difficult to obtain.

**Independents:**
Additional P.V. merchandising is being secured quickly.

Additional monies have assisted Region 17 in fighting PM Exclusives and PM/RJR
co-existence situations.

## Hardware Evaluation/Effectiveness: Comment on the assembly of displays and
application of shields:
The displays are easily assembled and durable. Some questions have been raised
concerning the inability to be flush with the counter and/or up against the register.
As well as the ability to place this on the Back Bar if the settlement goes through.

## Permanent Advertising Evaluation/Effectiveness/Acceptance: (P-1/P-5 & C-5

SUBJECT: STYLE LOW PRICE - PROGRESS REPORT

## EFFECTIVENESS OF Transition Plan
(Report on June 30 only)

PRE-SELL: Overall pre-sell efforts were successful. Retail accounts that previously stocked Style Full Price accepted the introduction of the low price.

BIGIF / 2 FOR 1: Proved to be an excellent tool for pulling the balance of Style Full Price packs through the system. This aided the field greatly during the transition.

$7.00 CARTON COUPON/BUYDOWN: Effective in those retail calls that we could not exchange product out of. These situations were limited.

(To be filled out by Marketing Research Department)

| Date | October 17, 1979 |
|---|---|
| PRODUCT | Triumph |
| PROJECT TITLE | Triumph Disaster Check Study |
| PROJECT # | 5546/1979 |

## Research Design (N, Cells, Eligibility, Design, Key Banner Breaks, Methodology, Cities)

Contact respondents from Buffalo and Kansas City who had previously participated in a steak knife offer. This will consist of one cell of approximately 175 respondents who are Triumph most often smokers/triers. This study is intended to provide us with any negatives associated with Triumph. Banner points will include Triumph most often smokers (we anticipate approximately 25 most often people), switchers away from Triumph (N approximately 45). It should be noted that an action standard of at least 50% be obtained in acting upon any product negatives associated with these groups—see research limitations below for additional action standard.

(See attached memo)

## Key Criteria For Analysis
- Triumph switchers asked why no longer smoking Triumph
- Present smokers of Triumph asked reasons for switching to Triumph
- Mentions of ""harshness""

## Research Limitations
Due to sample size and experience we feel 25 respondents will presently be Triumph smokers. An action standard of 75% should be utilized for judgements on product negatives only among this group.
If 75% of Triumph smokers mention ""harshness"" we could consider it a problem. If 50-75% of Triumph smokers mention ""harshness"" we could consider it a possible problem (look at other areas).
If below 50% of Triumph smokers mention ""harshness"" we could consider it not a problem.

Here is yet another version of the questionnaire. Please note that the last 2 pages are the alternate versions that we discussed. Take a look at the alternate Q9 to try to get at the intensity issue, and maybe we can improve on it from here.

By the way, we received 13 more signature cards today and sent the cigarettes out. We are now up to 74 respondents who have been sent cigarettes. Hopefully we will get a lot of callbacks this weekend.

Talk to you Monday. Thanks

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Cigarette Test Station (CTS400) combines many of the stand-alone instruments that R&D currently uses to measure cigarette weight, pressure drop, ventilation, and hardness into one compact module. The CTS400 has the additional measurement of cigarette hardness in comparison with the CTS300. With this added measurement R&D will be able to replace the Firmness Integrator that measures cigarette firmness in addition to other measurements that are mentioned above. The Firmness Integrator is no longer manufactured and spare parts are becoming difficult to obtain. Lastly, purchase of this instrument would provide similar capability as the Macon Plant and help facilitate comparisons between laboratories.

### SUGGESTION: (Describe Current Situation and Idea)

The current system of managing records is too complex. The trend seems to be increasingly specific, when we should be getting more general. Right now, people must work to understand the system. We must spend too much time administering the system, labeling, and cleaning our files. Complying is a real burden, both for the individual and for the records coordinators.

### Describe Possible Solutions and Benefits:

1. Drop the category specifications altogether.
2. Use more general categories.

Note: I have passed this to Scott Appleten for the task force to use in streamlining the records management program.

Assumptions Used in Arriving at Fiscal Estimate:

This bill regulates smoking in university buildings which house educational programs and in inpatient health care facilities. Smoking within these buildings would be allowed only in specified facilities or rooms, provided that signs are posted to designate ""smoking permitted"" areas.

It is estimated that, on the average, university buildings would each require about three ""smoking permitted"" signs. The per sign cost is estimated at $4.50 in 1982-83 dollars. This estimate is based on the 1981 per sign cost, and increased to reflect inflation from 1981 to 1983. Thus, the expected one-time cost for the University System to implement the provisions of the bill would be about $8,000. There are no significant continuing annual costs associated with the bill's provisions.

At the same time, KOOL replaced its product with a milder 11mg cigarette (the same KOOL Milds but with a 27mm cork tipping).

### DESIGN ON DISPLAY: (Condition And Rendition of Copy)

### COMMENTS: (Description of Location or Rotary Plan, Brand Category Competition)

This is a comparatively easy market to cover. It is less than an hour from Tampa airport. Our bulletins are on every major arterial and in all quadrants of the area. No changes were made. Some minor on-premise blocking and trees were noted, but not deemed serious enough for correction.

The only other tobacco in the market was a standing 6 Panel RJR buy currently showing Camel.

### COMMENTS ON PLANT: (Condition, Structures, Painting Ability, Lighting, Cooperation, etc.)

The plant is well maintained and covers all parts of the market. Lamar looks like a good citizen here, keeping a good-looking operation, doing public service, and carrying a lot of local advertisers.
